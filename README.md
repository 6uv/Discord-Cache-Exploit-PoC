# Discord Cache Exploit PoC

 Remote upload embedded payload in image using EOF to any Discord user's cache on their machine.
 
Depending on how NodeJS and Discord's cache system works, you could possibly make this a full remote code execution exploit.

## Step-by-step

### Step 1

Embed payload to an image that's less than 256 kb of size:
 `python3 embed.py <image> <python payload>`

### Step 2

Upload the image with the embedded payload to a Discord server as an emoji.

### Step 3

Send the emoji in a text channel. All members that displays the emoji will automatically download the emoji with the embedded payload to cache.
